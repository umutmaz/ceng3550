An Umutmaz Silverline Token is an ERC20 token implementation representing the silver hair with one to one mapping. That means for each token that umutmaz sent, there is one silver hair on his head due to the stress related to you! Kidding, that is just a funny story to come up with.
## Milestones of the Assignment

- Create a wallet account through a Web3 Provider (e.g. Metamask, Brave Crypto Wallets)
- Inject that wallet account to Ethereum Remix IDE
- Develop a token that implements ERC20 standards
- Deploy it to the Ropsten Test Network
- Send some tokens to the address "0xE3A6450F513424115E9f8617fef433F0245b46B6"



### Experiences
- Developed Smart Contracts Before
- Deployed Smart Contracts to Private Networks
- Interacted with those contracts

### Preassumed Challenges
- Never worked with Web3 Providers like Metamask before
- Never had a Crypto Wallet before
- Never worked with public networks



## Details

The contract is deployed to the  [Ropsten Test Network](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x960cdfe14d8e1a4591ceaac0b646909dc6942742), go ahead, click on it. Not willing to? Ok, the address of the contract is down below.

0x960CDfe14d8E1a4591ceAaC0B646909Dc6942742
```

The contract itself implements the IERC20.sol that is available on OpenZeppelin. Each method in the IERC20 collaboratively defines the standard of ERC20 tokens. Even though it is not completely safe to use compared to its descendent ERC223, it is one of the most common fungible tokens. 

## Achievements

- Learned to use the external Web3 Providers
- Learned to use the available public test networks
- Learned to come up with a story that does not make sense at all and still, funny.
